    <p>tinyhttpd is a very simple webserver. It is not for production use; instead it is primarily for a learning tool for persons investigating the http protocol and UNIX system calls.</p>
    <p>Despite its simple nature, tinyhttpd supports threading and CGI scripts! For more information, see the accompanying README file and the code itself. tinyhttpd is tested on Sparc Solaris and will probably not run on other operating systems as-is. However,</p>
    <p>commenting out the line that does threading may be all that is required to port it. I would like to autoconfiscate tinyhttpd at some point in time to help make it more portable. There is no downloadable release of tinyhttpd, yet. Until then, you can
        get it by anonymous CVS.
